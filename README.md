## API Key

This application uses the Unsplash API to fetch images. To use this application, you will need your own Unsplash API key. Follow these steps to obtain and set up your API key:

1. **Sign Up**: Go to the [Unsplash Developers](https://unsplash.com/developers) website and sign up for an account if you don't have one.

2. **Create a New Application**: After signing in, navigate to the "Your Applications" section and create a new application. This will generate an API key for you.

3. **Replace the API Key**: In the `app.js` file, find the following line and replace `"YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"` with your actual Unsplash API key:

   ```javascript
   headers: {
       Authorization: "Client-ID YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
   }
